## How to install

#### Manual addition
Open path 
```~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/Custom Templates```
 and copy template folder ``MVVM Module.xctemplate`` there.

If all it's ok you now could find your template in Xcode.

When you implement this template, Xcode creates folder links (blue folders) and the files in them will not appear in the project.
To solve this problem:
* Right-click on the added module and select "Delete/Remove Link".
* Next, return this address via Add files to.../Create groups.
